# rockpaperscissors-ai
My first project in Deep Learning. Model created using Keras, it can classificate images into rock, paper, scissors and none classes. Every image is converted via OpenCV Canny Edge Detection to get more meaningful data. It achieved 98.4% accuracy on test dataset and uses convolutional networks with few adjustments like dropout.
